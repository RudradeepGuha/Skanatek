### Running web application

In terminal, navigate to the project root folder, in this case, '.../mysite'. Then run the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Start a browser on the host machine and go to 'http://localhost:8000/dnt/', where 'dnt' is the app name and 8000 is the default port.
